# IntroIT_A1

My name is Zaidyn Melrose. My Student Number is s3866949. My Email address is s3866949@student.rmit.edu.au. 


I was born near Sydney, Australia.  I have lived in the suburbs my entire life. I completed Year 10 and commenced a Tafe Course, but due to personal reasons regarding my place of living, was never able to complete it. I have had two long term dreams. The first was to work at Google. I’ve been saying that ever since I could talk! The other is to own a Tesla, which I’ve already got on order, due in the coming months. I also have two guinea pigs, named Melody and Harmony, who are adorable. I love animals and am passionate about animal welfare.


My interest in IT has always existed. When I was three years old I somehow managed to get on my parents desktop PC and rearrange all their files into folders. This became more prevalent as I got older, such as teaching teachers at school how to use the electronic whiteboards.  As I moved out of home at a young age, I started my own business in IT Solutions fixing customers devices – both hardware and software however I have always been more interested in software. I have been running my own business for three years now, and while I don’t earn a lot from it, it has been a good thing to have under my belt. My full-time work is retail sales in IT and Telco. I sell phones, phone contracts, computers and other related items at JB Hi-Fi.


I chose to come to RMIT as a part of Open Universities. I have always been looking at doing a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. However, I have never been able to as a result of having to work three jobs in order to sustain myself and my life. This course is perfect for me as it is completely online, which means I can do the hours that suit me.  To get to my dream job, I will need this degree.


From my studies in this course I expect to learn a lot of the core skills required for my dream job to be a programmer. I will gain insight into the world of technology and be able to pursue my dream. I expect to learn how to program basic applications, syntaxes, variables, and other coding related skills. I also expect to learn how to utilise these skills in teamwork and to be able to collaborate with other people to get the job done.


My dream job is to work as a programmer for Google. Please see the following link https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/128706410675348166/ for the advertisement. Please also see these links to screenshots of the job in case of listing expiry. https://gyazo.com/9f5cef489407b5019c0ff80f66aaa5af https://gyazo.com/fa2b55ef588c70bd471fe92d98950b90 
This job has always been the job I’ve been wanting to do – my dream. Google is such an innovative place to work, awesome hangout areas, relaxed atmosphere and additionally a challenging workplace where team members can get work done productively and collaboratively.  People in this job work in a team to program Google’s software, test it, improve functionality of the code and also develop new programs and features. 


To work in this position, I will need at the very minimum, to complete this course I am enrolled in (Bachelors of Information Technology), and have experience in the workforce. This means that I will need to complete this degree and get a different job in the field of programming to get the experience I need to work for Google. I will also need experience working with Java, or a few other languages. I currently don’t have the needed skills or qualifications I need to get this job, however that is what I am working towards. I have very basic experience in teaching kids how to code using a program called ‘Scratch’. I also have experience in fixing IT related problems, both hardware and software, through my own business, and an extensive knowledge of parts and configurations of machines through my main job (IT Retail Sales). In terms of obtaining the qualifications needed for this position, as I have said already, I will be completing this course. For the skills and experience, my aim is to complete this course and then find an entry level programming job where I can gain more experience for a few years. I will also be most likely following this course up with a Masters if possible.


Result of Online Myer-Briggs Test:
- INTP - INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see.
- ISTP - ISTPs are observant artisans with an understanding of mechanics and an interest in troubleshooting. They approach their environments with a flexible logic, looking for practical solutions to the problems at hand.


Result of Online Learning Style Test:
Auditory: 55%, Visual: 15%, Tactile: 30%


Result of an IQ Test
IQ of 128 - top 3.01% of people.


Online testing can vary however for me they appear to have been reasonably accurate. These tests mean that I can learn and capable of learning new things. I am not surprised that I am more of an auditory and tactile learner rather than a visual learner as I find it difficult to copy visual things that I see online but prefer to listen through watching videos, movies and discussion. In school I enjoyed learning through making physical assignments and activities. 


I can be a natural leader if I am passionate about the topic, but I am also happy to work as part of a team and fit in with the group.  I will work best if a team is open to discussion and a hands-on approach as this is my learning style. 


It is important to recognise that everyone has different learning styles and no matter what the learning style we can work together to make an effective team if communication is at the centre of everything. Different learning styles can be a credit to a team and having a team with a mix of abilities and personalities will help for an effective team and putting together an amazing project.


My idea for a project is a universal car operating system which I would like to call CarOS. It will be a revolutionary open-source operating system, similar to Android, but for all the up and coming “smart” cars. It will include various interfaces for all things in the car, including speed, navigation, infotainment, and settings. It will have Apple Carplay, and Android Auto built in, among other things. The goal would be to develop a standard, something easily recognisable.


At the moment, this type of thing doesn’t exist. Several brands have their own operating system, including Tesla and Nissan, but a universal one does not exist. It would assist both existing automakers and new automakers alike move into the new smart car era that will be upon us soon led by Tesla. It will also likely generate a fair bit of money, as this type of technology is going to become more and more prevalent in the future. Without this no innovation will occur and traditional automakers will continue to be traditional as that is all they know.


This product would have many different parts to it. There would be multiple interfaces, each catering to a specific part of the car. First and foremost, it would need to be able to integrate to Apple Carplay and/or Android Auto, so a direct link would have to form there. Auto manufacturers would be able to customise the interfaces or any parts of the operating system if they so desire, or would be able to use the stock kit. There will be infotainment, and manufacturers would be able to install screens integrated into the back of the front seats, and somewhere on the dash for the front passenger, where other people would be able to watch movies, tv shows, listen to music with attached headphones, play games using a controller, and even things like Netflix built in. In the future, Self-Driving Cars will exist so it would be a good idea to have a screen in the centre of the car as well, maybe to even replace the steering wheel later on. It will also have three different navigation systems, allowing the user to choose their favourite. These will include Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. This is why both Apple Carplay and Android Auto would have to be integrated. This would involve liaising deals with these companies. You would also be able to navigate by the cars artificial intelligence system (AI) telling you where to go over the speakers, or you could even view it on a screen. Hence, there would be a drivers screen, replacing where the speedometer is in most common cars. This is where the maps and other settings and driving information would be displayed. The driver would be able to use a scroll wheel that is located on the steering wheel to change between interfaces, so the driver can change from navigation to infotainment and back easily. 


Vast amounts of software development will be needed for this. Tesla has actually made their code open-source (https://github.com/teslamotors). This is in order to help other manufactures, but there are a lot of limitations on what you can and can’t do with that code. You would also likely need many different cars or emulators to try out your software with. There will also need to be an SDK (software development kit) developed for car manufacturers to work with if they want to customise or change parts about the software.


This would be an enormous job, so you would need a whole team of outstanding professional developers. You would also need designers, QA testers, and UI Experts. An intuitive interface must be designed, and then developers must code that, and all the different parts, including speed, games, integrations such as Netflix etc. This would be tricky as you would have to hire an entire team, and coordinate, but it is definitely possible. It could be easier to collaborate with a company such as Google (Android).


If this project is successful, the outcome will mean several things. First off, it would generate a large amount of revenue.  A range of different car brands would use the software, as it means that they can focus on other things which is what they are actually good at – building cars. Traditional car brands aren’t developers. This would also mean that there is a universal system, so that if people change cars, they already know how to use it, rather than an entire new learning curve to endure. This will also accelerate all the traditional automakers into smart cars, for the future. Following this we might see several new carmakers enter the market and build their first car.
