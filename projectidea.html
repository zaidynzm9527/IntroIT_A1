My idea for a project is a universal car operating system which I would like to call CarOS. It will be a revolutionary open-source operating system, similar to Android, but for all the up and coming “smart” cars. It will include various interfaces for all things in the car, including speed, navigation, infotainment, and settings. It will have Apple Carplay, and Android Auto built in, among other things. The goal would be to develop a standard, something easily recognisable.
<br>
    <br>
At the moment, this type of thing doesn’t exist. Several brands have their own operating system, including Tesla and Nissan, but a universal one does not exist. It would assist both existing automakers and new automakers alike move into the new smart car era that will be upon us soon led by Tesla. It will also likely generate a fair bit of money, as this type of technology is going to become more and more prevalent in the future. Without this no innovation will occur and traditional automakers will continue to be traditional as that is all they know. 
<br>
    <br>
This product would have many different parts to it. There would be multiple interfaces, each catering to a specific part of the car. First and foremost, it would need to be able to integrate to Apple Carplay and/or Android Auto, so a direct link would have to form there. Auto manufactures would be able to customise the interfaces or any parts of the operating system if they so desire, or would be able to use the stock kit. There will be infotainment, and manufacturers would be able to install screens integrated into the back of the front seats, and somewhere on the dash for the front passenger, where other people would be able to watch movies, tv shows, listen to music with attached headphones, play games using a controller, and even things like Netflix built in. In the future, Self-Driving Cars will exist so it would be a good idea to have a screen in the centre of the car as well, maybe to even replace the steering wheel later on. It will also have three different navigation systems, allowing the user to choose their favourite. These will include Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. This is why both Apple Carplay and Android Auto would have to be integrated. This would involve liaising deals with these companies. You would also be able to navigate by the cars artificial intelligence system (AI) telling you where to go over the speakers, or you could even view it on a screen. Hence, there would be a drivers screen, replacing where the speedometer is in most common cars. This is where the maps and other settings and driving information would be displayed. The driver would be able to use a scroll wheel that is located on the steering wheel to change between interfaces, so the driver can change from navigation to infotainment and back easily. 
<br>
    <br>
Vast amounts of software development will be needed for this. Tesla has actually made their code open-source (https://github.com/teslamotors). This is in order to help other manufactures, but there are a lot of limitations on what you can and can’t do with that code. You would also likely need many different cars or emulators to try out your software with. There will also need to be an SDK (software development kit) developed for car manufacturers to work with if they want to customise or change parts about the software.
<br>
    <br>
This would be an enormous job, so you would need a whole team of outstanding professional developers. You would also need designers, QA testers, and UI Experts. An intuitive interface must be designed, and then developers must code that, and all the different parts, including speed, games, integrations such as Netflix etc. This would be tricky as you would have to hire an entire team, and coordinate, but it is definitely possible. It could be easier to collaborate with a company such as Google (Android).
<br>
    <br>
If this project is successful, the outcome will mean several things. First off, it would generate a large amount of revenue.  A range of different car brands would use the software, as it means that they can focus on other things which is what they are actually good at – building cars. Traditional car brands aren’t developers. This would also mean that there is a universal system, so that if people change cars, they already know how to use it, rather than an entire new learning curve to endure. This will also accelerate all the traditional automakers into smart cars, for the future. Following this we might see several new carmakers enter the market and build their first car.
