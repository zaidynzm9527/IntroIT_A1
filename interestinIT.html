My interest in IT has always existed. When I was three years old I somehow managed to get on my parents desktop PC and rearrange all their files into folders. This became more prevalent as I got older, such as teaching teachers at school how to use the electronic whiteboards.  As I moved out of home at a young age, I started my own business in IT Solutions fixing customers devices – both hardware and software however I have always been more interested in software. I have been running my own business for three years now, and while I don’t earn a lot from it, it has been a good thing to have under my belt. My full-time work is retail sales in IT and Telco. I sell phones, phone contracts, computers and other related items at JB Hi-Fi.

I chose to come to RMIT as a part of Open Universities. I have always been looking at doing a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. However, I have never been able to as a result of having to work three jobs in order to sustain myself and my life. This course is perfect for me as it is completely online, which means I can do the hours that suit me.  To get to my dream job, I will need this degree.
<br>
<br>
From my studies in this course I expect to learn a lot of the core skills required for my dream job to be a programmer. I will gain insight into the world of technology and be able to pursue my dream. I expect to learn how to program basic applications, syntaxes, variables, and other coding related skills. I also expect to learn how to utilise these skills in teamwork and to be able to collaborate with other people to get the job done.
