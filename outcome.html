    If this project is successful, the outcome will mean several things. First off, it would generate a large amount of revenue.  A range of different car brands would use the software, as it means that they can focus on other things which is what they are actually good at – building cars. Traditional car brands aren’t developers. This would also mean that there is a universal system, so that if people change cars, they already know how to use it, rather than an entire new learning curve to endure. This will also accelerate all the traditional automakers into smart cars, for the future. Following this we might see several new carmakers enter the market and build their first car.
