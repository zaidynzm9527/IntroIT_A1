Online testing can vary however for me they appear to have been reasonably accurate. These tests mean that I can learn and capable of learning new things. I am not surprised that I am more of an auditory and tactile learner rather than a visual learner as I find it difficult to copy visual things that I see online but prefer to listen through watching videos, movies and discussion. In school I enjoyed learning through making physical assignments and activities. 
<br>
I can be a natural leader if I am passionate about the topic, but I am also happy to work as part of a team and fit in with the group.  I will work best if a team is open to discussion and a hands-on approach as this is my learning style. 
<br>
It is important to recognise that everyone has different learning styles and no matter what the learning style we can work together to make an effective team if communication is at the centre of everything. Different learning styles can be a credit to a team and having a team with a mix of abilities and personalities will help for an effective team and putting together an amazing project.
