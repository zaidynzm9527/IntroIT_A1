My name is Zaidyn Melrose. My Student Number is s3866949. My Email address is s3866949@student.rmit.edu.au. 
I was born near Sydney, Australia.  I have lived in the suburbs my entire life. I completed Year 10 and commenced a Tafe Course, but due to personal reasons regarding my place of living, was never able to complete it. I have had two long term dreams. The first was to work at Google. I’ve been saying that ever since I could talk! The other is to own a Tesla, which I’ve already got on order, due in the coming months. I also have two guinea pigs, named Melody and Harmony, who are adorable. I love animals and am passionate about animal welfare.
