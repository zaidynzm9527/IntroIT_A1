This job has always been the job I’ve been wanting to do – my dream. Google is such an innovative place to work, awesome hangout areas, relaxed atmosphere and additionally a challenging workplace where team members can get work done productively and collaboratively.  People in this job work in a team to program Google’s software, test it, improve functionality of the code and also develop new programs and features. 
<br>
    <br>
To work in this position, I will need at the very minimum, to complete this course I am enrolled in (Bachelors of Information Technology), and have experience in the workforce. This means that I will need to complete this degree and get a different job in the field of programming to get the experience I need to work for Google. I will also need experience working with Java, or a few other languages. I currently don’t have the needed skills or qualifications I need to get this job, however that is what I am working towards. I have very basic experience in teaching kids how to code using a program called ‘Scratch’. I also have experience in fixing IT related problems, both hardware and software, through my own business, and an extensive knowledge of parts and configurations of machines through my main job (IT Retail Sales). In terms of obtaining the qualifications needed for this position, as I have said already, I will be completing this course. For the skills and experience, my aim is to complete this course and then find an entry level programming job where I can gain more experience for a few years. I will also be most likely following this course up with a Masters if possible.
